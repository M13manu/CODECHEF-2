# ***Programme to check the validity of the password***
* The user is prompted to enter a password.
* The password is checked to see if it is at least 8 characters long.
* If the password is less than 8 characters long, the user is prompted to enter a new password.
* If the password is 8 characters or longer, the program checks to see if it contains at least one upper-case letter, one lower-case letter, one digit, and one special character.
* If the password does not contain any of these, the user is prompted to enter a new password.
* If the password does contain one of these, the program checks to see if it contains any spaces.
* If the password contains a space, the user is prompted to enter a new password.
* If the password does not contain a space, the password is valid and the program ends.
